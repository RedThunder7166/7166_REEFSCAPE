There will be 2 sections of LED:
  FRONT & BACK SECTION (SECTION 1, representing group 1 & 3)
  MID SECTION (SECTION 2, representing group 2)

SECTION 1 will relay EVENTS.
  EVENTS trigger a certain color to flash on SECTION 1 for a few seconds
  EVENTS refer to specific actions that may occur such as the Robot rejecting or delaying user input
    example: User presses L4 button, but there's a piece going through the robot and thus
    the scoring mechanisms will not move until the piece is in a better position.
    Thi
  SECTION 1 will be look identical to SECTION 2 unless an EVENT has occured
  EVENTS will not have a queue, so when an action occurs, it will instantly override any previous EVENT being displayed.

SECTION 2 will relay STATE.
  STATE represents how able the Robot is to score a piece
  RED means no piece
  YELLOW means a piece is going through the Robot (think sensors)
  GREEN means a piece is ready to be scored
