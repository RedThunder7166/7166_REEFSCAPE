ordered by priority:
    * go to coral station at the end of 3 piece auto
    * account for yaw from reef
    * lower gantry position threshold? auto shoots before gantry is in position
    * in auto, start the correct orientation for the reef section (we would need to ensure drive team turns on the robot facing the alliance wall and then remove the code in autonomousInit)
