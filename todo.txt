ordered by priority:
    * elevator height account for X distance from reef
    * account for yaw from reef
    * lower gantry position threshold? auto shoots before gantry is in position
    * in auto, start the correct orientation for the reef section (we would need to ensure drive team turns on the robot facing the alliance wall and then remove the code in autonomousInit)
    * ignore gantry auto adjust when an april tag isn't visible (code exists (UNTESTED), just uncomment)
    * measure and add back in timeout for automaticcommands.createAutomaticGoToPositionCommand
